## Project Overview
This project blends environmental science with data engineering, leveraging ETL workflows and database design to provide actionable insights on salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest.

## The Problem
The Pacific Northwest is home to various salmon species, and their populations are deeply affected by environmental factors like water temperature. Scientists and environmentalists need data-driven insights to monitor these populations and understand how climate change impacts them. So, we in our group asked: How can we harness data to uncover trends and correlations in water temperature and salmon populations across different regions?"

See included PowerPoint for summary of key findings and visualizations.

## Ethical Considerations Made:

ðŸš¨ Accuracy and Data IntegrityðŸš¨
- Consideration: Ensuring the accuracy of the data is critical because inaccurate information could lead to incorrect conclusions and, consequently, harmful decisions.
- Ethical Action: Double-check data sources, apply rigorous data cleaning, and document all transformations to maintain data integrity. Provide transparency in your methodology so that others can replicate or validate your results.

ðŸš¨ Environmental ImpactðŸš¨
- Consideration: The analysis focuses on environmental data, which is highly sensitive and can have far-reaching implications for conservation and sustainability efforts.
- Ethical Action: Highlight the importance of using the data to support positive environmental actions, such as protecting vulnerable salmon populations or mitigating climate change effects.

ðŸš¨ Impact on Indigenous and Local Communities ðŸš¨
- Consideration: Many salmon populations are in regions with Indigenous communities who may rely on these fish for cultural, economic, or subsistence purposes. Environmental decisions influenced by your data could have direct effects on these communities..
- Ethical Action: Consider the broader social implications of your findings.

Recommendations:
- Clear Communication.
- Compliance and Sensitivity
