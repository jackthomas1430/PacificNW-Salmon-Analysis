## Getting Started
## Ethical Considerations Made:
For the Fisheries project, ethical considerations were addressed to ensure responsible handling of data and interactions with the public.

Here are some specific ethical considerations for our project:

* Privacy and Consent
  We ensured that the data collected about businesses, such as addresses, ratings, or owner information, was used responsibly and in compliance with privacy laws.

  We avoided capturing personal data of individuals visiting or reviewing the establishments such as posting user reviews without consent.

* Data Source Legitimacy
We verified that our data sources are legitimate and that we had the right to use the data, and we ensured compliance with terms of service for the data obtained from the third-party sources.

* Accuracy and Fairness
We have ensured that all information presented on the map is accurate and fairly represents the businesses, and have avoided any bias that could unfairly harm or benefit particular establishments.
